			<h1> Obstacles I Faced </h1>
			<hr> 

			<div class="text-div">
				<h3> Integer Division </h3>
				<p> I was aware that when you divide two integers together, the returned value would be rounded down to the nearest integer. What I wasnâ€™t aware of was that even if you set the variable that holds the integer division as a double, the output would still be the same, but casted to a double. </p>
				<p> This was a huge issue. I made the mistake of designing multiple methods at once, and when I went to test the class, the result were completely off. It took me hours to find out what was going wrong. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4685450/why-is-the-result-of-1-3-0">This stackoverflow thread </a> helped me find out my issue. </p> 				
			</div>

			<div class="text-div">
				<h3> GUI Layout </h3>
				<p> I had a very difficult time making the GUI appear how I wanted it to. I did a lot of research regarding Layout Managers and ended up finding out the proper way to display the Swing components. </p>
				<p> The JFrame's Layout Manager was the default Border Layout. I made one large JPaneland set its Layout Manager to the Box Layout, so it's component's would be stacked vertically. I then made several smaller JPanels, with a flow Layout Manager. These smallers JPanels would be added to the main JPanel, so they would stack. Inside these JPanels, I added adjacent components, thus displaying everything how I wanted it to appear.

			<h1> Reflections </h1>
			<hr> 
			<div class="text-div">
				<p> Overall, I feel like this project accomplished all the goals. I've learned a lot from this project, but one of the most important things I learned was the importance of double checking your code. I've wasted around 10 hours of my time from all the issues I faced due to the fact I was not checking my code, method at a time. I have since developed the habit of ensuring each method I make is working how it is supposed to.
